# ultimate-cli-handbook

The ultimate reference for copy and paste commands. I've been wanting to do this for a while, mostly to make life easier. There is currently no formality, so I'll be architecting that while simulatenously updating this repository.

This repository mostly consists of directions to immediate configurations. __Theory will not be discussed!__ For more information on this, please review the [FAQ](https://github.com/gil-ryan/ultimate-cli-handbook#learn-more-faq) below. Anyway, lets get down to business!

## Getting started

* Parameters are in italics, for examples:

> neighbor _ip-address_ remote-as _autonomous-system-number_

* User input parameters are generally in capital letters, many timess these parameters are optional. Example:

> neighbor _ip-address_ description __EXTERNAL NEIGHBOR [IP] - [ASN NAME] - [ASN #]_

## Networking

## Cisco

### Routing 

* [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-networking-public/blob/master/ROUTING-SWITCHING/BGP/BGP.md#bgp)
* [Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-networking-public/blob/master/ROUTING-SWITCHING/EIGRP/EIGRP.md#named-eigrp-quick-config)

### Routing Design

* [Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-networking-public/blob/master/ROUTING-SWITCHING/DMVPN/DMVPN.md)

## Palo Alto

Coming soon!

### What is this?

This repository provides links to handy copy-and-paste commands for different Information Technology appliances. It could be for just about any device, but usually devices that I personally work on.

* Routers
* Switches
* Firewalls
* UCS

### Why bother?

I, like most computer engineers, do not like repeating tasks over and over again. These commands allow me to find the right configuration, and apply it quickly and easily.

### How can I use this myself?

Pull requests will eventually be appreciated, but for now, most of the commands provided require a prerequisite or theoritical understanding of the technology discussed. Please feel free to reach out to me for additional materials. I will eventually be offering both paid and free tutorials, primers, and training, hopefully in the near future.
